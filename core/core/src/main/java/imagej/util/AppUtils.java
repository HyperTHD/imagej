	/**
	 * Gets the base file system directory from the given known class location.
	 * <p>
	 * This method uses heuristics to find the base directory in a variety of
	 * situations. Depending on your execution environment, the class may be
	 * located in one of several different places:
	 * </p>
	 * <ol>
	 * <li><b>In the Maven build directory.</b> Typically this is the
	 * <code>target/classes</code> folder of a given component. In this case, the
	 * class files reside directly on the file system (not in a JAR file). The
	 * base directory is defined as the toplevel Maven directory for the
	 * multi-module project. For example, if your have checked out
	 * <code>imagej.git</code> to <code>~/code/imagej</code>, the
	 * <code>imagej.ImageJ</code> class will be located at
	 * <code>~/code/imagej/core/core/target/classes/imagej/ImageJ.class</code>.
	 * Asking for the base directory for that class will yield
	 * <code>~/code/imagej</code>, as long as you correctly specify
	 * <code>core/core</code> for the <code>baseSubdirectory</code>.</li>
	 * <li><b>Within a JAR file in the Maven local repository cache.</b> Typically
	 * this cache is located in <code>~/.m2/repository</code>. The location will
	 * be <code>groupId/artifactId/version/artifactId-version.jar</code> where
	 * <code>groupId</code>, <code>artifactId</code> and <code>version</code> are
	 * the <a href="http://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Maven_Coordinates">Maven GAV
	 * coordinates</a>. Note that in this case, no base directory with respect to
	 * the given class can be found, and this method will return null.</li>
	 * <li><b>Within a JAR file beneath the base directory.</b> Common cases
	 * include running the application from a standalone application bundle (e.g.,
	 * the JARs may all be located within a <code>jars</code> folder of the
	 * application distribution archive) or using a JAR packaged by Maven and
	 * residing in the Maven build folder (typically
	 * <code>target/artifactId-version.jar</code>). However, this could
	 * potentially be anywhere beneath the base directory. This method assumes the
	 * JAR will be nested exactly one level deep; i.e., it computes the base
	 * directory as the parent directory of the one containing the JAR file.</li>
	 * </ol>
	 * <p>
	 * As you can see, it is quite complicated to find the base directory properly
	 * in all cases. The specific execution environments we have tested include:
	 * </p>
	 * <ol>
	 * <li><b>Running from Eclipse.</b> How Eclipse structures the classpath
	 * depends on which dependencies are open (i.e., project dependencies) versus
	 * closed (i.e., JAR dependencies). Each project dependency has a classpath
	 * entry <b>in its Maven build directory</b>. Each JAR dependency has a
	 * classpath entry <b>within a JAR file in the Maven local repository
	 * cache</b>.</li>
	 * <li><b>Running via Maven.</b> If you execute the application using Maven
	 * (e.g., <code>mvn exec:exec</code>, or with a fully Maven-compatible IDE
	 * such as NetBeans or IntelliJ IDEA) then all dependencies will reside
	 * <b>within JAR files in the local Maven repository cache</b>. But the
	 * executed project itself will reside <b>in its Maven build directory</b>. So
	 * as long as you ask for the base directory relative to a class
	 * <em>of the executed project</em> it will be found.</li>
	 * <li><b>Running the ImageJ application bundle.</b> Typically this means
	 * downloading ImageJ from the web site, unpacking it and running the ImageJ
	 * launcher (double-clicking ImageJ-win32.exe on Windows, double-clicking the
	 * <code>ImageJ.app</code> on OS X, etc.). In this case, all components reside
	 * in the <code>jars</code> folder of the application bundle, and the base
	 * directory will be found one level above that.</li>
	 * </ol>
	 * 
	 * @param classLocation The location from which the base directory should be
	 *          derived.
	 * @param baseSubdirectory A hint for what to expect for a directory structure
	 *          beneath the application base directory.
